I made this with other five people during the National High School Game Academe summer program at CMU. I am the leader of the team, work as both the artist and one of the programmer. 
# TheSeasoningOfLife
This is a 2d puzzle game. The main charactor is a panda, who lives in a world that there's only one season the whole year, winter. He gets a magic scarf that can make him switch between winter and a different season. He can use this machenic to solve the puzzle and get the gem for that season to store that season into his world.
